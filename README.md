# PRism: AI-Driven Code Review Tool

**Streamline your code reviews with flexible, AI-powered analysis**

PRism is an open-source, self-hosted AI tool designed to automate and enhance reviews of code, documentation, and more. It empowers teams to enforce standards, streamline workflows, and improve security without vendor lock-in or hidden costs. Choose any language model (LLM), including self-hosted ones via Ollama or open-source alternatives.

## üåü Key Features

- Define your team's standards in a `RULES.md`, YAML, or JSON file
- Enforce coding standards, documentation guidelines, and security best practices
- Automatically flag inconsistencies like mixed naming conventions or inadequate error handling

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Static Analysis + AI-Powered Review**
- Combines traditional static analysis with advanced AI reasoning
- Analyzes PRs based on your custom rule set
- Highlights style, security, and architectural concerns
- Provides actionable improvement suggestions

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Flexible LLM Integration**
- Choose the best model for your specific use case:
  - For code reviews: Models like OpenAI Codex or Mistral
  - For documentation: Models better suited for writing, such as GPT-4 or Claude
- Supports both open-source and commercial LLMs
- Configure via `prism-config.json` file

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **GitHub Integration**
- Automatically reviews pull requests when opened or updated
- Provides inline comments directly in your PRs
- Works with your existing GitHub workflow

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- GitHub account and repository (for GitHub integration)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkySingh04/PRism.git
   cd PRism
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure PRism**
   Run the CLI configuration tool to set up PRism for your use case:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   This will prompt you to select:
   - Your use case (code review, documentation review, etc.)
   - API endpoint for your LLM
   - Preferred language model

   Alternatively, you can manually create a `prism-config.json` file in the project root:
   ```json
   {
     "useCase": "Code Review",
     "apiEndpoint": "YOUR_LLM_API_ENDPOINT",
     "selectedModel": "YOUR_PREFERRED_MODEL"
   }
   ```

4. **Setup GitHub App (for GitHub integration)**
   
   - Create a new GitHub App in your GitHub account
   - Set the following permissions:
     - Pull requests: Read & Write
     - Repository contents: Read
   - Subscribe to pull request events
   - Generate and download a private key
   - Install the app on your repositories
   - Configure environment variables (create a `.env` file):
     ```
     APP_ID=your_github_app_id
     PRIVATE_KEY=your_github_app_private_key
     WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
     ```

5. **Start PRism**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## üìã Usage

### Define Review Rules
Create a `RULES.md` file in your repository with your team's standards:

```markdown
# Code Review Rules

## Naming Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces

## Error Handling
- All errors must be properly caught and logged
- No empty catch blocks allowed

## Documentation
- All public functions must have JSDoc comments
- Include examples for complex functions
```

### Running PRism Locally
To review code locally before committing:

```bash
npm run start
```

### GitHub Integration
Once configured, PRism will automatically:
1. Monitor pull requests in repositories where the GitHub App is installed
2. Analyze the code changes against your defined rules
3. Provide feedback as comments directly in the PR

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### Custom LLM Configuration
For using specific LLMs, update your `prism-config.json`:

```json
{
  "useCase": "Security Review",
  "apiEndpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions",
  "selectedModel": "gpt-4"
}
```

### Extending Rules
PRism supports multiple rule formats:
- `RULES.md` for human-readable rules
- JSON or YAML for machine-optimized rules
